# A Brief History of Silverwood Falls

Founded in **1884** as a logging outpost, Silverwood Falls grew around the rushing river that powered the town’s first sawmill. By the early 1900s, it became a stop on the **Northern Timber Railway**, which brought both trade and tourism.  

In the 1920s, a series of landslides nearly wiped out the town, but residents rebuilt with stone and timber — many of those historic buildings still stand on **Main Street** today.  

The falls themselves, for which the town is named, cascade nearly **120 feet** and were once sacred to the region’s Indigenous peoples, who called the area *Tálonak*, meaning *“place where the water sings.”*
