## Things to Do in Silverwood Falls

- **Hike the Misty Pines Trail**  
  A scenic loop that winds past waterfalls, wildflower meadows, and an old stone lookout tower.  

- **Silverwood Lake Kayaking**  
  Rent a canoe or paddleboard and explore the glacial-blue waters surrounded by towering evergreens.  

- **Starlight Observatory**  
  An old fire lookout repurposed as a public stargazing site. On clear nights, telescopes are set up for visitors.  

- **Maple Street Art Walk**  
  Local painters, potters, and woodworkers display their creations every Saturday morning.  

- **Autumn Harvest Festival** *(October)*  
  Cider tasting, pumpkin carving, and a lantern-lit parade through Main Street.
